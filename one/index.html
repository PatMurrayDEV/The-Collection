			<p>Welcome to the first edition on The Collection, if you would like to read about why this magazine exists or about the goals and missions please read the <a href="../prologue" class="black-link">Prologue</a>. The first edition features a mix of old and new articles, with time there will be a greater lean towards newer articles.</p>
			<p>Did you know that in many states in the US drivers licenses are oriented based on age? I found out the other day that in almost all states getting a license under 21 will result in the license being rotated vertically. Along with this, many establishments won't permit entry to ‚Äúvertical licenses‚Äù and in a lot of these states your license automatically expires when you turn 21, forcing a license renewal to get a horizontal license.</p>

	<h3><span class="number">1</span> How The New York Times Works</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="eight columns">
			<p>To kick off a new publication I see it only fitting to learn about how one of the most prominent and established publications runs. Wiedeman goes in depth to look at how everything from getting out sport scores at record pace, all the way to printing and distributing the most recognised newspaper in the world works.</p>
			<p>Obviously I'm biased towards enjoying this read, but Wiedeman has done a great job of covering so many aspects of the running of the NYT that most people will take something away from it. It's amazing how much technology is used in what is considered ‚Äúold media‚Äù, it really is a testament to the NYT‚Äôs ability to innovate in a shrinking market. </p>

	<h3><span class="number">3</span> No More Nudes in Playboy</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="eight columns">
		   <p>Unlike the NYT above, the web has destroyed Playboy's main premise. The only way for the company to overcome its dwindling sales and almost irrelevancy is to compete not with nudes but more ‚Äúcleaner PG-13‚Äù content. Already having toned down its online presence years ago to be allowed onto social networks with strict indecency policies (i.e., Facebook) Playboy makes most of its profit from licensing the name to the Chinese market.</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="eight columns">
		   <p>As someone who doesn't game very much (I don't have any consoles right now) simulation and city-builders have always been my favourites type of games. With the exception of the newest Sim City, the Sim City franchise has been a smash hit amongst gamers and non-gamers the world over. Richard Moss looks at twenty-six years of Sim City and the cultural influence the franchise has had on both itself and other games. </p>
		   <p>As an asside, I've been playing Cities: Skylines a lot this year, and while it's not perfect it's what Sim City 2013 should have been.</p>

	<h3><span class="number">5</span> Mum and Dad: The Similarity of Languages</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="eight columns">
		   <p>An interesting look at why across so many languages these two words are so similar. Hint: it has something to do with ease of making those sounds. I've always found it fascinating that English is the only language that calls the üçç pineapple the pineapple. Every other language uses some form of ‚Äúananas‚Äù. That is an easy one to explain, Columbus wanted an exotic name for the first exotic fruit from the New World.</p>
		   <p>It's still intersting how mum and dad transcend millennia of language. Oh, and then in Finnish it's is√§ and √§iti. </p>
