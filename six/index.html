            <p>Follow up to last week’s comment about Adele’s latest album <em>25</em>, it seems the Pandora have the rights to stream it online. Like Taylor Swift last year, Adele has used her popularity to pull her album from music streaming services with the hope (and success) to see more copies. This controversial move has sparked some debate about whether this is good for all musicians or good for just Adele. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/25/9800508/25-streaming-pandora-radio-service-licensing">Pandora, the internet radio service, has confirmed</a> that they (due to their peculiar license with the US government) are streaming <em>25</em> right now. </p>

			<p>A <a href="http://sputniknews.com/russia/20151123/1030602483/scientology-church-ban.html">Moscow court has banned the church of Scientology</a>, claiming that the use of trademarks voids its right as a religion under Russian law. </p>

			<blockquote>
			  "The representatives of the Church of Scientology have created many legal conflicts by themselves by restricting the religious freedom through the use of trade marks," the Ministry of Justice said.</blockquote>

			<p>The Australian federal government <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/30171755/no-jab-no-pay-laws-pass-parliament/">passed their “no-jab-no-pay” laws</a> this week. With exceptions only for medical reasons, the parents of children who are not immunised will be have childcare benefits, rebates, and the Family Tax Benefit A end-of-year supplement removed. The catch obviously is that this will in some cases even further negatively impact these children, whom have no choice. </p>

			<p>Some of you may have seen <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/2015/01/20150123_saudi.jpg">this poster</a> going around the internet this week, comparing the Saudi legal system to the ISIS punishment system. Well <em>“Saudi Arabia will <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/ashraf-fayadh-saudi-arabia-to-sue-twitter-user-describing-palestinian-poets-death-sentence-as-isis-a6749591.html">sue any Twitter user who compares</a> the Kingdom’s recent decision to execute a poet to punishments handed down by Isis.”</em></p>

			<blockquote>
			  "The justice ministry will sue the person who described ... the sentencing of a man to death for apostasy as being `Isis-like'," a justice ministry source told newspaper Al-Riyadh.</blockquote>

			<p>There are only <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/only-3-northern-white-rhinos-left-on-earth/">three remaining northern white rhinos</a> in the world, after Nola, a 41-year-old female, who arrived at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in 1989 died this week. The remaining rhinos are too old to effectively reproduce, however sperm samples are currently held in liquid nitrogen in the Czech Republic. </p>

			<p>A <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/chief-coca-cola-scientist-leaves-amid-criticism-over-obesity-research/">Chief Coca-Cola scientist has left amid criticism over obesity research</a> foundation he funded. Rhona Applebaum, Coca-Cola’s chief scientist and health officer, has been accused of setting up a nonprofit designed to downplay the role of sugary drinks in obesity. The University of Colorado has returned the $1 million to Coca-Cola after news came out about the connection. They claim that research was not influenced by the money. </p>

			<p>Lastly, a <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20151127/swedish-court-we-cannot-ban-pirate-bay">Swedish district court has ruled</a> that a telco does not have the block the Pirate Bay. Big Hollywood/Music brought the case the Swedish courts, where they proposed that by not blocking the site they were participating in copyright piracy. The court ruling as unanimous. This is a blow to anti-piracy bodies, as it sets precedent. </p>

	<h3><span class="number">1</span> Identity Is an Inside Joke</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="eight columns">
			<p>A look at how jokes and humour play into our relationships and feeling of belonging. In this article, it is speculated that the best type of relationship building joke is the "the short humorous anecdote leading to a punchline.". On an international scale, it appears that the best jokes are those that play into wealth and gender stereotypes. Jokes allow people to stretch into offensive territory and test the waters of their peers.</p>	
			<blockquote><p>When we don't get a joke, we feel left out; when we get a joke, or better yet, tell the joke that everyone roars at, we belong.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="eight columns">
			<blockquote><p>But don’t worry: This isn’t a rags-to-riches story. I loathe the I-did-it-all-by-myself heroic myth mongering. I got where I am thanks to government-sponsored maternity leave, child care, health care, education, and even cash assistance. I grew up in housing provided by AAB, a union-founded affordable housing association.</p></blockquote>
			<p>A look at the almost assured let down that is insane wealth. David, founder of Basecamp and Ruby on Rails, compares it to an overhyped movie. It is easy for someone already in that position to note that it doesn't make everything better, so David says that there's nothing that can be said that will convince anyone otherwise. It's up to each person to discover what happiness is indipendent of wealth on their own.  </p>
			<blockquote><p>“It was like I had pulled back the curtain on that millionaire's dream and found, to my surprise, that most of the things on the other side were things I already had.”</p></blockquote>

			<p>How Walmart keeps an eye on employees to ensure that nothing goes wrong for their biggest day of sales for the year: Black Friday. </p>

				<p>In the autumn of 2012, when Walmart first heard about the possibility of a strike on Black Friday, executives mobilized with the efficiency that had built a retail empire.</p>
				<p>OUR Walmart, a group of employees backed and funded by a union, was asking for more full-time jobs with higher wages and predictable schedules.</p>
				<p>Walmart's aim isn't only to watch 100 or so active members of OUR Walmart, says Kate Bronfenbrenner, a lecturer at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="eight columns">
			<p>In May 2014, the North Korean government detained a mild-mannered municipal worker from Ohio named Jeffrey Fowle. His crime? Leaving behind a Bible in the restroom of a bar he'd visited with his tour group. Fowle’s captors soon learned that the offense wasn’t an accident. Rather, Fowle claimed to be on a mission from God, sent to bring the Holy Book to support underground Christians in North Korea. In this article, Joshua Hunt reveals Fowle’s day-to-day existence during his Kafkaesque detention and explores the mind and motivations of the man who risked his freedom inside a brutal regime.</p>
